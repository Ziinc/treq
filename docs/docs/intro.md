## What is Treq?

AI agents can create results fast, but they don't organize anything. Their outputs stack on top of each other, overwrite previous work, and make it hard to see what changed or what should happen next.

**Treq fixes that by adding structure.**

It gives each agent result its own space, shows it clearly to the developer for review, and guides the agent to the next step.

Now, instead of a messy pile of AI output, you get a clean, organized workflow you can control.

## Key Features

- **🌳 Agent Isolation**: Coding agents work in isolation on dedicated Git worktrees, paralleized and isolated.
- **💻 Integrated Terminal**: Use Claude Code in full inteactive mode, with seamless integeration with planning modes and Git worktree management
- **🔍 Code Review**: Inspect and iterate on each change for a human-in-the-loop agentic workflow.
