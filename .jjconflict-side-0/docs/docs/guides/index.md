## Popular Workflows

### Feature Development
The most common workflow: create a worktree for a new feature, develop in the terminal, stage and commit changes, then merge back to main.

**Quick Path**: [Installation](getting-started/installation) → [Your First Worktree](getting-started/your-first-worktree) → [Staging and Committing](core-workflows/staging-and-committing) → [Merging Worktrees](core-workflows/merging-worktrees)

### Code Review
Review pull requests without leaving your main development environment. Create a worktree from the PR branch, review with inline comments, and provide feedback.

**Quick Path**: [Creating Worktrees](common-tasks/creating-worktrees) → [Code Review Workflow](core-workflows/code-review-workflow)

### Parallel Development
Work on multiple features simultaneously, each in its own worktree with separate terminal sessions and build outputs.

**Quick Path**: [Creating Terminal Sessions](core-workflows/creating-terminal-sessions) → [Moving Files Between Worktrees](common-tasks/moving-files-between-worktrees)
