# Troubleshooting

_Common issues and solutions when using Treq._

## Performance

**Slow with large repositories**: Run `git gc --aggressive` to clean up, add large folders (`node_modules/`, `dist/`) to `.gitignore`, or increase the polling interval in Settings → Performance.

**Dashboard updates slowly**: Delete unused worktrees (keep only 5-10 active), disable auto-refresh, or clear cache in Settings → Advanced.

**Terminal laggy**: Reduce scrollback lines in Settings → Terminal, or switch renderer from WebGL to Canvas. Commands with huge output may pause temporarily.

## Worktrees

**Not appearing in dashboard**: Delete the `.treq` folder and reopen Treq—data will rebuild from the filesystem.

**Can't delete worktree**: Commit or discard changes first, close terminals using that worktree, or force delete with `git worktree remove --force path/to/worktree`.

**"Branch already checked out"**: Each branch can only have one worktree. Delete the existing worktree for that branch or choose a different branch name.

## Staging

**Can't stage files**: Check if the file is in `.gitignore` with `git check-ignore -v path/to/file`. To force add an ignored file: `git add -f path/to/file`.

## Merging

**Merge conflicts**: View conflicted files with `git status`, open them in your editor, find the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`), choose or combine versions, remove markers, then `git add` the resolved file and commit.

**"Uncommitted changes" preventing merge**: Commit changes in the target branch, or stash them with `git stash` (then `git stash pop` after merging), or discard with `git checkout -- .`

**Undo a merge**: Abort an ongoing merge with `git merge --abort`. If already committed, use `git reset --hard HEAD~1` (warning: loses changes).

## General

**"Git not found"**: Ensure Git is installed and in your PATH. On macOS, restart Terminal after installing. On Windows, reinstall Git with "Add to PATH" checked.

**"Invalid Git Repository"**: Select the folder containing `.git`, not a subdirectory. Initialize with `git init` if needed.

**App won't start**: Check platform-specific security settings (Gatekeeper on macOS, SmartScreen on Windows). On Linux, ensure FUSE is installed for AppImage.
