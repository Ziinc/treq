# How to Run Multiple Claude Code Sessions

_Start several Claude Code agents at once without sharing one working directory._

## Goal

Run two or more Claude Code sessions on the same repository, each on its own branch and working copy, then review and merge their results independently.

## Prerequisites

- A Git repository with a clean or committed `main`
- Claude Code installed and available as `claude` on your `PATH`
- Enough disk for one dependency install per worktree

## CLI-first setup with git worktrees

Fetch current `main`, then create one worktree per task:

```bash
git fetch origin

git worktree add -b agent/payments-retry ../repo-payments-retry origin/main
git worktree add -b agent/search-filters ../repo-search-filters origin/main

git worktree list
```

Install dependencies in each worktree if the project needs them:

```bash
npm install --prefix ../repo-payments-retry
npm install --prefix ../repo-search-filters
```

Start Claude Code inside each directory, in separate terminal tabs:

```bash
cd ../repo-payments-retry
claude

# other tab
cd ../repo-search-filters
claude
```

Give each session one task, the files it may change, and the tests it must run. Do not point two sessions at the same directory.

When a session finishes:

```bash
cd ../repo-payments-retry
git status
git diff
git push -u origin agent/payments-retry
```

Open a pull request, review it, and only then start another large task for the same reviewer.

## Setup with Treq workspaces

In Treq, create one workspace per task from the dashboard. Each workspace gets a directory under `.treq/workspaces/` and its own bookmark. Start a Claude Code session from the workspace so the process inherits that working directory.

See [Agent Sessions](/docs/concepts/agent-sessions) and [Workspaces](/docs/concepts/workspaces).

## Common failure cases

**Both sessions share the home checkout.** Symptoms include interleaved edits, unexpected `git status`, and agents fighting over the same file. Fix by moving each session into its own worktree before continuing.

**Same branch checked out twice.** Git blocks a second worktree on the same local branch. Use unique branch names per session.

**Stale base after the other PR merges.** Rebase the remaining worktree:

```bash
git -C ../repo-search-filters fetch origin
git -C ../repo-search-filters rebase origin/main
```

**Orphan worktree after a killed terminal.** Remove or prune it:

```bash
git worktree remove ../repo-payments-retry
# or, if the directory is already gone:
git worktree prune
```

**Review queue overflow.** Cap concurrent sessions to what you can review the same day. Unused finished branches go stale and create conflicts later.

## Cleanup

```bash
git worktree remove ../repo-payments-retry
git worktree remove ../repo-search-filters
git branch -d agent/payments-retry agent/search-filters
```
