# Treq - Coding Agent Orchestrator - test 

Treq transforms AI-generated code into local isolated pull requests.

## What is Treq?

AI agents can create results fast, but they don’t organize anything. Their outputs stack on top of each other, overwrite previous work, and make it hard to see what changed or what should happen next.

**Treq fixes that by adding structure.**

It gives each agent result its own space, shows it clearly to the developer for review, and guides the agent to the next step.

Now, instead of a messy pile of AI output, you get a clean, organized workflow you can control.

## Features

### Code Reviews

Inspect and iterate on each change for a human-in-the-loop agentic workflow.

- Review the code diffs just like a familiar Github PR, annotate and comment on code, and then send it to an agent for changes.
- Spotted an issue when browsing files? Send it to an agent for adjustments in the background.

### Isolated Workspaces

Coding agents work in isolated copies of the codebase, ensuring changes are independent from each other while keeping your current repository clean for planning.

- Workspaces are isolated but interlinked - move changes around workspaces, or split and stack workspaces as needed.
- Got a code conflict? No problem! Let the agent handle it the grunt work.
