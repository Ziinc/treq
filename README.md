# Treq - Coding Agent Orchestrator

Treq transforms AI-generated code into local isolated pull requests.

## What is Treq?

AI agents generate code fast, but their outputs stack up unorganized, making it hard to track changes. Treq adds structure by giving each agent result its own workspace for clear review and iteration.

## Features

### Code Reviews

Review changes like GitHub PRs with annotations and comments. Send feedback to agents for adjustments.

### Isolated Workspaces

Agents work in isolated copies of the codebase, keeping changes independent and your repository clean. Move changes between workspaces, split and stack them, or let agents resolve conflicts.
