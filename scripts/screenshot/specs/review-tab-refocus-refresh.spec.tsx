/**
 * Verifies that the Changes tab picks up on-disk file edits made while the
 * window was unfocused, once the window regains focus. This covers the case
 * where an already-modified file gets edited further: the file's jj status
 * doesn't change (it's still just "modified"/"added"), so the file-watcher
 * event and a plain file-list refresh both stay silent -- only re-fetching
 * hunk content on focus surfaces the new lines.
