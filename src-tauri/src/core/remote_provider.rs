//! Provider-neutral managed compute contracts.
//!
//! This module defines the domain model for a Treq-managed VM: the normalized
//! lifecycle state machine, the [`ManagedComputeProvider`] adapter trait that a
//! vendor integration (Fly Sprites first) implements, VM size presets, region
//! records, and the versioned boot manifest. Nothing here talks to a vendor
//! API; that begins in a later phase. UI and repository code must depend only
//! on the types in this module, never on vendor SDK types or status strings.
