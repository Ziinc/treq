/// Before the fix, `jj_working_copy_needs_sync` treated "bookmark != @" as
/// "needs sync", so the pull leg moved `@` back onto the bookmark and discarded
/// the working-copy commit, and `sync_home_and_workspace_for_branch` pointed the
/// bookmark at `@` — the empty working-copy commit — so an empty commit got
/// pushed to the remote.
